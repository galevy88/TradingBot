# TradingBot

This Script is TradingBot-Test. I found trading-view SDK and reached endpoints to get indicators data for cryptocurrencies.

This Script contains a list of changeable assets and their USDT trading value according to the trading view.

I created a (DEMO)API_USER for future testing that simulates a real trading option and fee calculation that trades and switches between assets depending on the asset price and indicators.

The Script generates 3 files: 1. Recommendation list suggested by trading view 2. Indicators data 3. trading transactions payload

For futuristic purposes, I'm aiming to implement the logic of ML (Thinking now about Random Forest but more options can be valid and implemented together) and also connect this Script to Binance API User and test it in Prod env
